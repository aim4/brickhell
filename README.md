# brickhell

A Lego inspired take on the Bullet Hell style game, made using C# in Godot.

I followed this helpful [example](https://github.com/erdavids/Bullet-Hell-Tutorial) along with the corresponding Youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMNl9Ix6ng8&list=PLvN5Z3tTxXECLLXBLSxJ_KzeJuwlt1r4q) and expanded upon it.
